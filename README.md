The "Home" section introduces Jackson with a prominent heading and a concise tagline highlighting their specialization in AI-driven backend development. The "About" section delves deeper, providing a brief biography where Jackson expresses their passion for building secure, scalable, and intelligent backend systems. It emphasizes their expertise in integrating AI to optimize workflows, enhance automation, and improve data-driven decision-making. The section also details their proficiency in databases, APIs, and cloud technologies, showcasing their ability to develop robust and high-performance server-side applications.

Additionally, media queries are implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes, optimizing the layout for both desktop and mobile viewing. The footer is styled with a subtle background and positioned at the bottom of the page, providing a consistent and professional look.

In summary, this code creates a comprehensive personal portfolio website that effectively showcases Jackson's skills and experience as an AI-driven backend developer. The combination of HTML and CSS creates a visually appealing and informative platform for visitors to learn about Jackson's expertise and projects.
